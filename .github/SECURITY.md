# Security Policy

This repository hosts the **investor demo** materials for the FORITECH project.
While it is not intended for production use, we welcome responsible vulnerability reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Please do not** open public issues for security topics.
- Report privately via **GitHub Security Advisories** or email: **security@foritech.example** (temporary: **forrybg.hh@gmail.com**).
- Include a clear description, impact, and reproduction steps. Proof-of-concept is appreciated.

## Triage & Response
- We aim to acknowledge reports **within 3 business days**.
- We will coordinate a fix or a mitigation and a disclosure timeline with you.
- Sensitive details may be kept private until users can reasonably update.

## Scope
- Content and CI in this repository (`forrybg/foritech-investor-demo`).
- Out of scope: third-party services, unrelated repos, and non-security content issues.

## Responsible Disclosure
We follow coordinated disclosure best practices. Thank you for helping improve our security posture.
